To correct the issues, ensure there are no unnecessary spaces around the +,-,*,/ operators within the `calc()` function. Also, ensure consistency and correctness in the units used within the calculation.  Always double-check your calculations and units to prevent unexpected behavior.  Example of corrected code: `width: calc(100% - 20px);` instead of `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` and correct unit usage.
