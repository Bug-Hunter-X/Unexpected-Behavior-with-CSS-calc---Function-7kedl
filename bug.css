The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you have spaces around the operators within the `calc()` function, it might lead to unexpected results. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` is correct, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` might not render properly.  Another potential issue is incorrect unit usage within `calc()`, which can cause errors. For instance, mixing percentages and pixels without proper consideration can lead to incorrect calculations.
